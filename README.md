Title : Unveiling Political Sentiment : Twitter analysis on Indian Election
with Topic Modelling
This research investigates political sentiment during Indian elections through Twitter data analysis on
Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. It employs advanced Natural Language Processing techniques,
including BERT, TextBlob, and VADER sentiment analysis tools, alongside topic modeling. BERT
embeddings provide contextual sentiment understanding, while TextBlob allows for comparative
analysis of computational complexity versus sentiment analysis performance. VADER explores rule- based sentiment analysis efficacy. Comparative polarity score analysis, coupled with insights from
topic modeling, reveals sentiment expression patterns and disparities. This study contributes to
understanding sentiment dynamics, aiding researchers and policymakers in gauging public opinion
and making informed decisions based on nuanced political discourse on social media. Dataset link:
